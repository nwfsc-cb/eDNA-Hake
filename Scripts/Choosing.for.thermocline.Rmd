## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r load dataset}
eDNA.samples <- read_csv(file = here("Data", "eDNA hake water samples.csv")) %>% 
  rename(Station = `CTD cast`)
CTD.stations <- read_csv(file = here("Data", "cleaned_CTD_stations.csv"))


```

We want to choose 8 transects that reflect the differences in latitude, strength of thermocline and its depth


![Samples and the temperature of the surface waters](../Plots and figures/plots.for.choosing.png)

And the winners are transects 81, 77, 67, 60, 53, 39, 35, 26. From them we will choose the stations closest to shore, the furthest and one in between


```{r joining}

eDNA.samples %>% 
  left_join(CTD.stations) %>% 
  separate(Station, into = c("Transect","position"), remove = F) %>% 
  filter (Transect %in% c(81, 77,67,60,53,39,35,26)) %>% 
  select(Transect, position, depth, `Tube #`, lat, lon) %>% 
  distinct() -> eDNA.samples.transects 
  
  eDNA.samples.transects %>% 
    select(eDNA.sample = `Tube #`, everything()) %>% 
    write_csv(here("Data", "eDNA.samples.with.lat.lon.csv"))

```
