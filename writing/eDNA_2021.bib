@article{Burton-camera-2015,
	Abstract = {Summary Reliable assessment of animal populations is a long-standing challenge in wildlife ecology. Technological advances have led to widespread adoption of camera traps (CTs) to survey wildlife distribution, abundance and behaviour. As for any wildlife survey method, camera trapping must contend with sources of sampling error such as imperfect detection. Early applications focused on density estimation of naturally marked species, but there is growing interest in broad-scale CT surveys of unmarked populations and communities. Nevertheless, inferences based on detection indices are controversial, and the suitability of alternatives such as occupancy estimation is debatable. We reviewed 266 CT studies published between 2008 and 2013. We recorded study objectives and methodologies, evaluating the consistency of CT protocols and sampling designs, the extent to which CT surveys considered sampling error, and the linkages between analytical assumptions and species ecology. Nearly two-thirds of studies surveyed more than one species, and a majority used response variables that ignored imperfect detection (e.g. presence--absence, relative abundance). Many studies used opportunistic sampling and did not explicitly report details of sampling design and camera deployment that could affect conclusions. Most studies estimating density used capture--recapture methods on marked species, with spatially explicit methods becoming more prominent. Few studies estimated density for unmarked species, focusing instead on occupancy modelling or measures of relative abundance. While occupancy studies estimated detectability, most did not explicitly define key components of the modelling framework (e.g. a site) or discuss potential violations of model assumptions (e.g. site closure). Studies using relative abundance relied on assumptions of equal detectability, and most did not explicitly define expected relationships between measured responses and underlying ecological processes (e.g. animal abundance and movement). Synthesis and applications. The rapid adoption of camera traps represents an exciting transition in wildlife survey methodology. We remain optimistic about the technology's promise, but call for more explicit consideration of underlying processes of animal abundance, movement and detection by cameras, including more thorough reporting of methodological details and assumptions. Such transparency will facilitate efforts to evaluate and improve the reliability of camera trap surveys, ultimately leading to stronger inferences and helping to meet modern needs for effective ecological inquiry and biodiversity monitoring.},

@article{Robinson-2014,
	Abstract = {Summary Landscapes are becoming increasingly intensively managed resulting in greater anthropogenic disturbance of ecosystems. Effective policies for conservation and management of wildlife populations will require a mechanistic understanding of the processes underlying the population responses to these changes. Detailed demographic studies are often of individual populations in relatively stable habitats, whereas there is a need to characterize demographic variation at larger scales in wider landscapes that are subject to environmental change. We use long-term (18--46 years) data sets, gathered by volunteers across Britain, to parameterize Bayesian state-space demographic population models for 17 widely occurring bird species. As some demographic processes were not quantified directly, we introduce a scaling parameter (œÅ) to account for this unmeasured variation, and assess the extent to which this influences our ability to understand the processes driving population change. The population models provided a good fit to the population trajectory in all but one species (the nocturnal tawny owl Strix aluco). The scaling parameter generally showed little annual variation and did not make a major contribution (<12\%) to population change among passerine species. For five non-passerine species, the contribution was still not large (11--21\%), but did indicate the importance of unmeasured demographic variables in these species. We were able to retrieve known demographic signals both within and across species. The importance of the nest failure rates was greater for species that construct nests in open rather than cavity situations. We also confirmed the demographic causes of population decline in two species of conservation concern, song thrush and lapwing, as changes in juvenile survival and reproductive success respectively. Furthermore, we show that population dynamics of declining species are generally driven more by recruitment than increasing species (for which variation in adult survival is more important). These analyses demonstrate that volunteer-based monitoring programmes can provide insight into population changes at large spatial scales across a range of species. By facilitating the combination of data sets on different demographic parameters, the integrated approach adopted here allows important demographic parameters to be identified, even if they are not measured directly.},

@article{Maunder-2013,
	Abstract = {Limited data, and the requirement to provide science-based advice for exploited populations, have led to the development of statistical methods that combine several sources of information into a single analysis. This approach, ``integrated analysis'', was first formulated by Fournier and Archibald in 1982. Contemporary use of integrated analysis involves using all available data, in as raw a form as appropriate, in a single analysis. Analyses that were traditionally carried out independently are now conducted simultaneously through likelihood functions that include multiple data sources. For example, the traditional analysis of converting catch-at-length data into catch-at-age data for use in an age-structured population dynamics models can be avoided by including the basic data used in this conversion, length-frequency and conditional age-at-length data, in the likelihood function. This allows for consistency in assumptions and permits the uncertainty associated with both data sources to be propagated to final model outputs, such as catch limits under harvest control rules. The development of the AD Model Builder software has greatly facilitated the use of integrated analyses, and there are now several general stock assessment models (e.g., Stock Synthesis) that allow many data types and model assumptions to be analyzed simultaneously. In this paper, we define integrated analysis, describe its history and development, give several examples, and describe the advantages of and problems with integrated analysis.},

@article{Ahrestani-integrated-2017,
	Abstract = {Abstract Integrated population models (IPMs) provide a unified framework for simultaneously analyzing data sets of different types to estimate vital rates, population size, and dynamics; assess contributions of demographic parameters to population changes; and assess population viability. Strengths of an IPM include the ability to estimate latent parameters and improve the precision of parameter estimates. We present a hierarchical IPM that combines two broad-scale avian monitoring data sets: count data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and capture--recapture data from the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) program. These data sets are characterized by large numbers of sample sites and observers, factors capable of inducing error in the sampling and observation processes. The IPM integrates the data sets by modeling the population abundance as a first-order autoregressive function of the previous year's population abundance and vital rates. BBS counts were modeled as a log-linear function of the annual index of population abundance, observation effects (observer identity and first survey year), and overdispersion. Vital rates modeled included adult apparent survival, estimated from a transient Cormack-Jolly-Seber model using MAPS data, and recruitment (surviving hatched birds from the previous season + dispersing adults) estimated as a latent parameter. An assessment of the IPM demonstrated it could recover true parameter values from 200 simulated data sets. The IPM was applied to data sets (1992--2008) of two bird species, Gray Catbird (Dumetella carolinensis) and Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) in the New England/Mid-Atlantic coastal Bird Conservation Region of the United States. The Gray Catbird population was relatively stable (trend +0.4\% per yr), while the Wood Thrush population nearly halved (trend ‚àí4.5\% per yr) over the 17-yr study period. IPM estimates of population growth rates, adult survival, and detection and residency probabilities were similar and as precise as estimates from the stand-alone BBS and CJS models. A benefit of using the IPM was its ability to estimate the latent recruitment parameter. Annual growth rates for both species correlated more with recruitment than survival, and the relationship for Wood Thrush was stronger than for Gray Catbird. The IPM's unified modeling framework facilitates integration of these important data sets.},

	Abstract = {Technologies to identify individual animals, follow their movements, identify and locate animal and plant species, and assess the status of their habitats remotely have become better, faster, and cheaper as threats to the survival of species are increasing. New technologies alone do not save species, and new data create new problems. For example, improving technologies alone cannot prevent poaching: solutions require providing appropriate tools to the right people. Habitat loss is another driver: the challenge here is to connect existing sophisticated remote sensing with species occurrence data to predict where species remain. Other challenges include assembling a wider public to crowdsource data, managing the massive quantities of data generated, and developing solutions to rapidly emerging threats.},

A range of technology options relevant to ecologists and conservation practitioners are described, including ways they can be linked to increase the dimensionality of data collection efforts. Remote sensing, ground-based, and data fusion technologies are broadly discussed in the context of ecological research and conservation efforts. Examples of technology integration across all of these domains are provided for large-scale protected area management and investigation of ecological dynamics. Most technologies are low-cost or open-source, and when deployed can reach economies of scale that reduce per-area costs dramatically. The large-scale, long-term data collection efforts presented here can generate new spatio-temporal understanding of threats faced by natural ecosystems and endangered species, leading to more effective conservation strategies.},

However, it is unclear whether this apparent missing, or {\textquotedblleft}dark,{\textquotedblright} diversity of megafauna results from local species extirpations or from failure to detect elusive remaining individuals. We find that despite two orders of magnitude less sampling effort, environmental DNA (eDNA) detects 44\% more shark species than traditional underwater visual censuses and baited videos across the New Caledonian archipelago (south-western Pacific). Furthermore, eDNA analysis reveals the presence of previously unobserved shark species in human-impacted areas. Overall, our results highlight a greater prevalence of sharks than described by traditional survey methods in both impacted and wilderness areas. This indicates an urgent need for large-scale eDNA assessments to improve monitoring of threatened and elusive megafauna. Finally, our findings emphasize the need for conservation efforts specifically geared toward the protection of elusive, residual populations.},

@article{Pinol2014,
	Abstract = {The quantification of the biological diversity in environmental samples using high-throughput DNA sequencing is hindered by the PCR bias caused by variable primer-template mismatches of the individual species. In some dietary studies there is the added problem that samples are enriched with predator DNA, so often a predator specific blocking oligonucleotide is used to alleviate the problem. However, specific blocking oligonucleotides could co-block non-target species to some degree. Here we accurately estimate the extent of the PCR-biases induced by universal and blocking primers on a mock community prepared with DNA of twelve species of terrestrial arthropods. We also compare universal and blocking primer biases with those induced by variable annealing temperature and number of PCR cycles. The results show that reads of all species were recovered after PCR-enrichment at our control conditions (no blocking oligonucleotide, 45$\,^{\circ}$C annealing temperature and 40 cycles) and high-throughput sequencing. They also show that the four factors considered biased the final proportions of the species to some degree. Among these factors the number of primer-template mismatches of each species had a disproportionate effect (up to five orders of magnitude) on the amplification efficiency. In particular, the number of primer-template mismatches explained most of the variation ({\~{}}3/4) of the amplification efficiency of the species. The effect of blocking oligonucleotide concentration on non-target species relative abundance was also significant, but less important (below one order of magnitude). Considering the results reported here, the quantitative potential of the technique is limited, and only qualitative results (the species list) are reliable, at least when targeting the barcoding COI region.
